                                What are the differences between Flowbite and Tailwind UI?

                                <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                                    The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite are open source under
                                    the
                                    MIT license, whereas
                                    Tailwind UI is a paid product. Another difference is that Flowbite relies on smaller
                                    and
                                    standalone
                                    components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.

                                    However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite Pro, and even Tailwind
                                    UI
                                    as there is no
